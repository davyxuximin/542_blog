These aren’t the works of science fiction—they’re the real-life applications of machine learning.\nMachine learning is a transformative field where computers learn patterns from data, enabling them to make predictions, solve problems, and even adapt to new challenges without being explicitly programmed. It’s the invisible engine powering innovations in healthcare, finance, entertainment, and virtually every industry you can think of.\nIn this tutorial, I will be teaching how to create a classification model (a model that is used to classified an item) using sci-kit learn package. A detail of the example used can be found in the repository here"

Before taking out your wallet and writing a cheque, you want to analyze the value for money of the car. From the appearance of it, you can see some attributes, including the number of doors, seating compacity and boot size. Besides, financial cost including buying price and maintenance cost are also important when considering the cost performance. After gathering these information, you hope there exists a robot telling you the car is acceptable or not. The robot you hope is the model we are going to train later this tutorial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Picture of a woman purchases a car, picture created by (McIntosh 2022)\n\n\n\nThe dataset(Bohanec 1988) we are going to use contains a large number of these information. You can find the data in here. This is a data from UCI machine Learning Repository. You need to download it to your local before continue this tutorial, you can also find it in the repo. I recommed to download it at the data/ of the root of your project."

    "text": "Quick inspection of the data and do analysis on it\nThe next thing needed to do is do a inspection to the nature of the data. Because we want to create a classification model, we shall make sure that the target we are predicting is a classification data, then we need to see the data type of the attributes:\n\nprint(raw_data.head())\nprint(raw_data.info())\n\nAs we can see, the dataset have all object datatype, and the target we want to predict is the class of the car. The car attributes is as follow:\n\nBuying price: low, med, high, vhigh\nMaintenance cost: low, med, high, vhigh\nNumber of doors: 2, 3, 4, 5more\nSeating capacity: 2, 4, more\nBoot size: small, med, big\nSafety rating: low, med, high\n\nThe class column includes the following value:\n\nunacc: Unacceptable. Cars that fail to meet basic criteria.\nacc: Acceptable. Cars that meet minimum requirements.\ngood: Good. Cars that exceed average standards in some aspects.\nvgood: Very good. Cars that meet the highest standards.\n\nIn machine learning, the features are usually denoted as X, and the target is denoted as y, we can do as following:\n\nX = raw_data.drop(\"class\", axis=1)\ny = raw_data[\"class\"]\n\nCan we start training the model using this data? No! Why? Because if we train the model using all the data here, we will have no data to test it. The golden rule of the machine learning indicates that we shall never use test data to train the model. Therefore, we need to split the data into train set and test set. Luckily, sci-kit learn has a module to split them in one line:\n\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(\n    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=522\n)\n\nBy doing so, we split the data by 20% test and 80% train. Before heading to train the model, the sci-kit learn model will only accept numeric columns to train. We need to transform our categorical columns to numeric before fitting the model. Here, since all columns are ordinal(low, med, high etc.). We can use a sklearn encoder called OrdinalEncoder. This encoder can transform ordinal categorical column value like ‘low’ ‘medium’ ‘high’ to 0, 1, 2:\n\ncar_preprocessor = make_column_transformer(\n        (OrdinalEncoder(categories=[['low','med','high','vhigh']]), ['buying']),\n        (OrdinalEncoder(categories=[['low','med','high','vhigh']]), ['maint']),\n        (OrdinalEncoder(categories=[['2','3','4','5more']]), ['doors']),\n        (OrdinalEncoder(categories=[['2','4','more']]), ['persons']),\n        (OrdinalEncoder(categories=[['small','med','big']]), ['lug_boot']),\n        (OrdinalEncoder(categories=[['low','med','high']]), ['safety']),\n        remainder='passthrough',\n        verbose_feature_names_out=False\n    )\n\nBy doing this, we encode the columns to numeric, which is now good for our model to fit."

You can think of SVM as a tool that draws lines in a way that best separates different categories—in this case, car acceptability levels. As we get deeper into machine learning, we will need to tune the hyperparameter of the model. This process is like looking for a way to adjust car components to make it drive the fastest. Instead of car components, we adjust the hyperparameter of the model. Since this is a beginner tutorial, I will provide a good hyperparameter C is equal to 100 and gamma is equal to 0.1 to this model here.\n\nsvc = SVC(C = 1000, gamma = 0.01, random_state=522)\ncar_pipe = make_pipeline(car_preprocessor, svc)\ncar_pipe.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\nThere are other models in sklearn package like Random Forest classifier or KNN classifier.

    "section": "Test our model",
    "text": "Test our model\nNow we have trained our model using the training data, how are we suppose to test the performance of our trained model? Well, remember the test data we splited out earlier this tutorial? Now it’s the time to use it. We can give the features from the test data to our model and let it predict the outcome, and calculate the accuracy of the model. We can use the .score() function of sklearn to do this:\n\nscore = car_pipe.score(X_test, y_test).round(3)\nprint(f\"The accuracy of our mode is {score}\")\n\nThe accuracy of our mode is 0.965\n\n\nBesides accuracy, we can create a classification report using sklearn module:\n\npredictions = car_pipe.predict(X_test)\nprint(classification_report(y_test, predictions))\n\n              precision    recall  f1-score   support\n\n         acc       0.88      0.97      0.93        76\n        good       0.92      0.80      0.86        15\n       unacc       1.00      0.98      0.99       240\n       vgood       1.00      0.87      0.93        15\n\n    accuracy                           0.97       346\n   macro avg       0.95      0.90      0.92       346\nweighted avg       0.97      0.97      0.97       346\n\n\n\nThe precision here means how many predictions are correct and recall means how many relevant items are identified. F1 score gives a balance between the 2 metrics. Given the high score and accuracy here, we can say that the model we built is powerful and reliable. We can also see a detail here, how many cars we are doing correct and how many we are doing incorrect, just use a confusion matrix like Figure 3:\n\ncm = ConfusionMatrixDisplay.from_estimator(\n    car_pipe,\n    X_test,\n    y_test,\n    values_format=\"d\", \n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Confusion matrix visualizing the performance of the SVC RBF model, displaying the true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives in a tabular format to assess classification accuracy and error rates.\n\n\n\nNow, let’s try to predict using our model:\n\n#Create 2 car with one obviously good and one obviously bad\npredict_data = pd.DataFrame({\n    'buying': ['low', 'high'],\n    'maint': ['med', 'vhigh'],\n    'doors': ['4', '2'],\n    'persons': ['4', '2'],\n    'lug_boot': ['big', 'small'],\n    'safety': ['high', 'low']\n})\npredictions = car_pipe.predict(predict_data)\nprint(\"Predictions for the new data:\")\nfor i, prediction in enumerate(predictions):\n    print(f\"Sample {i+1}: {prediction}\")\n\nPredictions for the new data:\nSample 1: vgood\nSample 2: unacc\n\n\nThe result is good and accurate!"
